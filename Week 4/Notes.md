## Week 4

**Hybrid Multi-cloud**
Hybrid Cloud is a computing environment that connects and organizations on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud into a single infrastructure for running the organization's applications. Multicloud is a cloud adoption strategy that embraces a mix of cloud models from different service providers - public, private, and managed, across infrastructure, platform, or software services. Another reason for adopting hybrid multicloud strategy is to prevent lock-in to a specific vendor's cloud platform and having flexibility of being able to move workloads from one cloud platform to another as the need arises.

**Microservices**
Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable, smaller components or services. These services typically have their own stack running on their own containers. They communicate with one another over a combination of APIs, event streaming, and message brokers. For a business, what this means is that: Application components can be developed and updated more efficiently by multiple developers working independently. Teams can use different stacks and runtime environments for different components. Components facing too much load can be scaled independently, reducing the waste and cost associated with having to scale entire applications. **Service discovery**, which creates a roadmap for these and many other microservices to communicate.

**Serverless Computing**
Serverless is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks such as scaling, scheduling, patching, and provisioning application stacks to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on the code and business logic specific to their applications or process. Serverless doesn’t mean there are no servers; only that the management of the underlying physical or virtual servers is removed from their users. The serverless computing environment allocates resources as needed for the applications.

**Key attributes**
1. No provisioning of servers
2. Runs code on-demand, scaling as needed
3. Pay only when invoked and used

**Applications that qualify for a serverless architecture include:**
1. short-running stateless functions
2. seasonal workloads
3. production of volumetric data
4. event-based processing
5. stateless microservices

Hybrid Multicloud is a cloud adoption strategy that makes it possible for public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT to interoperate seamlessly while leveraging the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.

Microservices architecture is an approach in which an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services, leading to efficient development, maintenance, and upgradation cycles.

Serverless Computing is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks for application runtimes to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.

**Cloud-Native Applications**
A cloud native application is an application developed from the outset to work only in the cloud environment, or an existing app that has been refactored and reconfigured with cloud native principles. A cloud native application consists of microservices working together as a whole to comprise an application, yet each can be independently scaled and iterated through automation and orchestration processes. These microservices are often packaged in containers, which are executable units of software in which the application code is packaged along with its libraries and dependencies so that it can be run anywhere. This independence enables frequent, iterative improvement of cloud native applications, without disrupting the experience of end-users.

**DevOps on Cloud**
Combining development and operations with the ability to monitor and analyze and optimize bottlenecks gives us DevOps, a collaborative approach where business owners and the development, operations, and quality assurance teams collaborate to continuously deliver software. A DevOps approach applies agile and lean thinking principles to all stakeholders in an organization who develop, operate, or benefit from the business’s software systems, including customers, suppliers, partners. It allows developers to produce software in short iterations, and a continuous delivery schedule of new features and bug fixes in rapid cycles. Businesses can seize market opportunities and accelerate customer feedback into products. DevOps Process involve continuous delivery, integration, deployment, monitoring, and delivery pipeline which consists of ideation, coding, building, managing, and continuous improvement. DevOps in the cloud allows for automated provisioning and installation, continuous integration and development pipelines, define how people work together and collaborate, test in low-cost, production-like environments, and recover from disasters by rebuilding systems quickly and reliably.

Cloud native applications are applications that are built or refactored to work in the cloud environment. These applications, developed using DevOps methodologies, consist of microservices packaged in containers that can run in any environment—making it possible to create and update features in quick iterative cycles.

DevOps is a collaborative approach that enables development and operations teams to continuously deliver software in quick iterative cycles while reducing overhead, duplication, and rework. DevOps’ tools, practices, and processes help tackle the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud, allowing solutions to be delivered and updated —quickly and reliably.

Application Modernization helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics. Cloud computing is one of the key enablers of application modernization.
