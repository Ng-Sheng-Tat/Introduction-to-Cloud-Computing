## Week 1

**Core Concepts of Cloud Computing**
1. Essential Characteristics
2. Service & Deployment Models
3. Security & Monitoring
4. Cloud Architecture
5. Emerging Technologies
6. Career Opportunities

**Definition**
- a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Computing resources include networks, servers, storage, applications, services.

**Five Essential Characteristics**
1. On-demand self-services: pay-as-you-go
2. Rapid Elasticity: can be scale conveniently
3. Broad Network Access: easily accessible
4. Resource Pooling: storage-efficient
5. Measured Service

**Cloud Computing As A Service**
- cost-efficient
- more agile to market changes

**Cloud Deployment Models**
1. Public: shared by other company
2. Private: not shared
3. Hybrid

**Three service models**
1. *Infrastructure* as a Service (IaaS)
2. *Platform* as a Service (PaaS)
3. *Software* as a Service (SaaS)

- before modern development days, Capital Expense (CapEx) is used which incur high-cost, now it is Operating Expense (OpEx), where scaling can be done easily, and eventually you pay what you have needed and used only.

**Cloud Adoption Motivating-Factors**
1. Agility
  - strategic value
2. Competitiveness
  - efficiency
3. Flexibility
  - infrastructure and workloads
  - SaaS and development platform
  - speed and productivity
  - risk exposure (Virtual Cloud Platform, Encryption, API key

**Challenges for cloud adoption**
- data security
- governance and sovereignty issues
- legal, regulatory, and compliance issues
- lack of standardization
- choosing the right deployment and service models
- partnering with the right cloud service providers
- disaster

 Some major Cloud providers of our times include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.

  **IoT equipted with cloud**
  1. Device registration
  2. Device identity
  3. Storing data
  4. Accessing enterprise data

  **AI gets data from IoT and use cloud to deploy**
  - application is using tennis match to stay competitive in providing users experience

**BlockChain together with AI in the cloud**

BlockChain is a secure, immutable network that allows members to view only the transactions that are relevant to them. It provides trusted, decentralized source.
